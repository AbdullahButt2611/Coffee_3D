  Responsive Landing Page
</h3>


<br><br>

<p align="justify">

A responsive landing page for a coffee hop with some dynamic event on mouse hovering allowing user a perfectly interactive interface. <br>
This repository contains the code for a landing page for a coffee shop. The landing page is designed to promote the coffee shop, showcase its products and services, and provide customers with information on location, hours of operation, and contact details.<br>
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's designed to be responsive, which means it will adjust to different screen sizes and devices, and will work on both desktop and mobile. The website is visually appealing and easy to navigate.<br>
To run the code, you will need to have a web server and a browser that support the latest web technologies. The repository has the necessary files to run the landing page and you can use them as a starting point for your own projects or improvements.
